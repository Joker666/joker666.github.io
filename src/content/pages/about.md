## Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm a Software Engineer.

I've been a writing software for almost 10 years now and wrote my first program in C# when I was 16 years old. It was a little console game. Thanks to my friend who inspired me.

I landed my job at the age of 20 while still in school, learning the intricacies of computer science. Balancing full-time work and studying was challenging, and I faced some roadblocks along the way. However, with perseverance, I was able to overcome them. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from NSU with an 80% grade.

I spent the next few years coding, traveling, discovering new places, taking pictures, and interacting with the unknown. I haven't stopped working since. I've worked in three incredible companies and built fascinating things. And there's more to come.

Today, I am working at a startup that focuses on improving people's sleep. I am also learning photography, planning to start blogging again, and happily married to the most incredible woman I have ever met.
